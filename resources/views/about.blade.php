                    <p>Jeeb is an innovative grocery delivery service that makes grocery shopping fast, easy, and hassle-free. This revolutionary approach was an idea of the Jeebâ€™s CEO, Mr. Bashar Jaber, to deliver groceries right to the doorsteps. Although there were many food delivery services working in Qatar, none offered grocery delivery. Jeebâ€™s CEO, Mr. Bashar Jaber, wanted the grocery delivery to be simple, easy and as fast as possible. Thatâ€™s why he came up with an idea Jeeb calls 2-step delivery. Using Jeeb, you can order all your grocery items at once by just uploading the list, or writing them on the app's built-in notepad, and the logistics department will deliver your item as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>With Jeeb, you can order everyday items, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, meat, household products, snacks, pet care, cereals, pharmacy, beverages, and more from the store to your doorstep.

                    <p>At Jeeb, we strive to bring our customers the best grocery delivery experience
                        possible. That's why we have three core values: customer focus, time efficiency,
                        and simplicity. Customer focus is a top priority for us. We aim to make our
                        customers feel valued and to provide them with excellent service every time. We
                        believe our customers should always come first, and that's why we prioritize their
                        satisfaction above all else. Time efficiency is also an important value for us. We
                        know our customers lead busy lives and don't always have time to shop for
                        groceries. That's why we make the process quick and easygoing. We want our
                        customers to be able to get their groceries delivered right away, so they can get on
                        with their day. Finally, we value simplicity and strive to make our app intuitive and
                        user-friendly. We want our customers to be able to order their groceries with just
                        a few taps and without any hassle. Jeeb believes that these values are the key to
                        providing our customers with the best grocery delivery experience.</p>
